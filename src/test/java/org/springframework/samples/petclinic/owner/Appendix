3: We did not tested private methods of the said class. A private method is an
implementation detail that should be hidden to the users of the class.
Testing private methods breaks encapsulation. In the unlikely case that the private method
is huge or complex that it needs it's own test, It is advised to put it in another class and
make it public there. This change is also referred to as "Method Object". The link below is
a detailed explanation of this method:

Also we can analyse behavior of the methods using the said private method.

4: There's not a definitive way to ensure thread safety by using unit test. Threading is actually
an OS method and there's a lot of uncertainty associated with it. Different runs might have different
sequence of thread execution. Locks (such as mutex or semaphores) can be used within the actual code
in order to ensure concurrent modification can not happen.
Although this matter is in great dispute and has to be cared manually, there are some prebuilt structures or types which are useful.
To name a few, we can mention ConcurrentHashMaps or also transactional relations.
The specific test about thread safety in the petTest class too, can support our claim. Each time you run that particular test you could see different results.

5:

-- public void testA(): Needs to check directly to see whether the result is correct or not.
    it's actually not a @Test method. No errors are raised though.

-- public void testB(): Class definition is flawed since it has "()" in front of it.
    Besides, since the bar method is capable of either throwing an exception or returning the result,
    both of the possible outcomes should be well evaluated. So, there should be tests corresponding to each behavior.
    One for testing the validity of the result value returned from the called method, and other test must monitor the expected thrown exception.
    Also if we want to use the only test method there we should add try/catch block in order to prevent getting exceptions while
    running test


-- public void testC(): As said in the third chapter, it is best to denote which type of exception is expected to be
    received by the method. testC() will know whether there has been an exception or not but it will not know the type
    of it so it's better to have a separate test for each expected exception type.
